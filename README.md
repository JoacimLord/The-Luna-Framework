# The-Luna-Framework

This is a demo "game" made in 30 minutes using The Luna Framework.
It's more of an example to see how the API works.

The game logic isn't perfect and there is some glitching going on with the collision between the paddle and the ball, but it gets the idea across!
Feel free to use this demo as your own starting point!

Simply clone or download the project. Run the Setup.bat file to generate your solution and that's it.


Thanks for checking it out!
